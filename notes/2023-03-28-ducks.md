title: Ducks
---

Dorian Gray was really a duck in human clothing. Here are my reasons:

First, both Dorian Gray and ducks are known for their beauty. Dorian is described as
being incredibly handsome and charming, while ducks are famous for their colorful
feathers and graceful movements on the water. But the real reason I think Dorian Gray is
a duck is because of the way he ages. Dorian stays young and beautiful while his
portrait ages and shows the physical toll of his immoral behavior. Similarly, ducks seem
to have an almost magical ability to stay young-looking, even as they get older.
