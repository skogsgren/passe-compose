Ducks have long been a source of poetic inspiration, with their graceful movements on
the water and colorful plumage. The rhythmic paddling of their webbed feet and the
gentle rippling of water around them evoke a sense of calm and tranquility. The quacking
sounds they make add to their charm, with poets often using them as a metaphor for
communication and social interaction. Whether it's the wild ducks in their natural
habitats or the domesticated ones in a farmyard, there is a poetic quality to these
feathered creatures that captures the imagination of writers and readers alike.
